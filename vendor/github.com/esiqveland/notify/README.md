Notify is a go library for interacting with the dbus notification service defined by freedesktop.org:
https://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/

`notify` can deliver desktop notifications over dbus, ala how libnotify does it.

Please note `notify` is still in motion and APIs are not locked until a 1.0 is released.

More testers are very welcome =)

Depends on:
 - [godbus](https://github.com/godbus/dbus).
